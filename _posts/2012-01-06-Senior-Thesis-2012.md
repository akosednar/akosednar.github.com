## Preface ##

For my senior year in High School, we must write a thesis. This is what this is. Please note, all text is copyright to Anthony Kosednar 2012. I am putting it up here while I work in order to share it with others for revision. I do not authorize the reuse of my work…Do not share!"

####Overview of the Senior Thesis Curriculum:####


*"The culminating project for an Academy student is the senior thesis. At the beginning of the senior year, the student selects a field of inquiry from the curriculum - literature, philosophy, math, science, the arts - and then selects a faculty member to act as his or her thesis advisor. The thesis is an exploration of one of the "Six Great Ideas" of humanity summarized as Truth, Beauty, Goodness, Justice, Liberty, and Equality. The first semester involves the selection of readings, directed study, note-taking, and conversation with the advisor. The second semester involves the writing of the thesis in sections, with the advisor offering feedback and guidance at each successive stage. The thesis is not a research paper, and it should not attempt to prove a specific point. Rather, the senior is asked to logically develop and assertively present his or her own philosophy on a topic of personal interest derived from the chosen texts. The thesis culminates with the senior defending his or her final draft in front of a committee of three faculty member."* - [Chandler Prep Curriculum Description](http://www.chandlerprep.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=71&layout=default&date=2012-01-01)

## Introduction ##

<!-- Citation: http://www.fi.edu/color/rainbow.html -->

One of the most simple, yet beautiful things in nature is that of a rainbow. A rainbow at its base is simple an arch of colors in the sky that ones sees. However, when one dives deeper into this simple display of nature they are confronted with some interesting facts. First off, when one looks upon a rainbow most people think it is made up of only the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. However, a rainbow is actually made of colors that even one's eyes can not see. That though is not the only thing unique and special about this simple thing. Rainbows are formed by light refracting water droplets at a 42&deg; angle and strike the view's eye. However, two view's eyes can not be in the same place at the same time. Thus, no two people receive the refracted light. As a result, every person  who looks upon a rainbow, see their own "personal" rainbow. To some, this might seem like an intriguing  "fun fact" to share with friends in some form of entertainment. To some philosophers, this simple "fun fact" presents a problem. 

According to some philosophers, one does not simply know a rainbow. <!-- Lord of the rings reference lol: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=0tMv5uj0odM ---> After realizing the nature of how a rainbow is observed, a philosopher is bombarded with a series of questions: How should one actually view a rainbow? Since every vantage point from which a person views this rainbow is unique, which vantage point is the true or best vantage point? Another question that might be asked is, if every one of these vantage points are unique, how can they all still be the same rainbow? On the other side, though, an ignorant person might put this thought aside stating, "This is a phenomenon and does not come about often," or, "It is a trivial thing, and thus we should not concern ourselves with it." However, a well versed reader will be quick to point out to you that this simple difference of vantage points causes immense differences in how things are viewed. A situation like this comes forth in Abbott's work, *Flatland*.

In *Flatland*, Abbott presents forth to the reader a scene of a square who is unaware of the world (dimensions) around him. The square believes that the way he sees and is able to understand things in is simple two dimensional vantage point must be the only way things should be understood. It is not until a series of events, including looking upon things in dimensions below himself, as well as being ripped from his own dimension of existence into another, that he is pulled into "the light", truth. From these new vantage points, he is able to fully see himself, and his relationship to everything else. As a result of his new found enlightenment, he is compelled to announce to the world his revelations. This is much like how the philosopher Hearne’s feels the need to confess the truth and thus write *Bandit*.

In Vicki Hearne's *Bandit*, Vicki Hearne is a professional (a professional dog trainer to be more specific). However, at the same time, she is a philosopher. As a result, since they are both a part of herself, she must appeal to both. One scene that clearly presents this troubling split is that of her brining Bandit out of the pound. During this scene, while she is taking off Bandit's collar, she pinches her finger in it. From this simple moment, results to completely opposite responses. As a professional, she does not confess to those around her that she has done this. However, the lack of laying out the truth compels her to confess the experience in the form of a book. Thus, creating the book in which this whole scene takes places. Through this book, she is able to examine herself from the vantage point of overlooking herself. This is much like how Plato's Socrates is able to, with his metaphor of the city and his soul, fully view himself. <!-- Insert Plato Stuff somehow here?? -->Aristotle ponders upon the method or force that allows this movement.

Aristotle presents to us a force: a mechanism by which one is able to move. The means that cause movement prove a way in which a man is able to move between viewpoints – perspectives. As a result, in Abbott’s language, he gives us the force that allows a person to move “upward” not just northward. By that, it is meant that he provides the force that allows something to move in and out of something not just across. This is the same as when Plato pulls someone out of his cave in order to bring them out of a lie and towards the truth.

In order to know truth, it must be known fully. This simple statement might seem self-explanatory but it is discovered that this is not the case. How can someone fully know something? In Abbott’s *Flatland*, the shapes debate this and determine that sight is inferior and angles are the best. However, the square later discovers that this is not the best method. As soon as he moves outside of his viewpoint, his rules of knowing suddenly become insufficient. They are found not be applicable to each dimension. He finds that there are many ways of knowing a truth based on the perspective. As a result, to truly know something, he finds it must be known from all perspectives. Thus, the square discovers he didn’t fully know, as he didn’t know it from the vantage points of all the dimensions.

These authors present forth a framework, a compiling of a set of perspectives that are a kind of dimensional way of viewing truth based on a person’s analyzing of their self in relationship to ultimately the universe. The first being that of realizing one’s existing and being able to view one’s self internally. The second is one’s relationship with others (humans). The third dimension is being able to look upon the relationship of one’s self and his other taken as one compared to the rest of world. Finally, the fourth is creation’s relationship with the divine. This is one’s cosmic relationship – one’s relationship with his universe, existence, divine, creator, or the ultimate highest truth.

According to these authors, a thing must be analyzed in the order of these perspectives. Therefore, in order to find the truth of the universe, a man must not only know truth from a single sight, but rather see it from all perspectives. A man who does not see a thing from all perspectives does not truly know it. Thus it can be said: <u>Man’s compounding climb of perspectives gives him the global vantage point to fully see and thus identify truth.</u> <!-- I hate underlining just fyi -->

## Overview of Our Exploration ##

<!-- Definitions Outline???? Here?? -->

When attempting to build a chair, one can suddenly stand up and decide, "I am going to build a chair." However, one can not go ahead and build that chair without first determining how they are going to first go about building that chair properly. In making of a chair, artists take time to determine what it should look like, and how they should go about to make the chair. In this way they are provided a path to follow on their course of chair making that helps them reach their ultimate goal of making a chair. Similarly, before going about the endeavor of determining qualities of the nature of perspective, and truth, a plan of attack must be made. As a result, before diving deeper into the topic at hand, some guiding questions, and a plan of attack must be laid out.

To gain a set of questions, one must contemplate the primary texts. In Abbott's 



As a result the following are gained as the guiding questions:

* What are the vantage points from which you can identify truth?

* What vantage point does man need to identify truth?

* How does man move through these vantage points?

* How does man know he has the right identification?

These are our primary guiding questions, because, as you will discover throughout this paper, are universal to all the primary texts.

After gaining a plan of attack must be outlines.

 

In asking this question, one seeks to identify specifically the nature (essential qualities), location, and significance of these vantage points. It must also be kept in mind that in asking this question, all the vantage points are laid out from which truth can be identified, instead of simply the best ones or the ones from which man uses. 

* What are the vantage points from which you can identify truth?

* What vantage point does man need to identify truth?

* How does man move through these vantage points?

* How does man know he has the right identification?

I actually have no clue if this paragraph is needed soooo lets skip it for now and focus on other paragraphs.
