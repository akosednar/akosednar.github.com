## Preface ##

For my senior year in High School, we must write a thesis. This is what this is. Please note, all text is copyright to Anthony Kosednar 2012. I am putting it up here while I work in order to share it with others for revision. I do not authorize the reuse of my work…Do not share!"

####Overview of the Senior Thesis Curriculum:####


*"The culminating project for an Academy student is the senior thesis. At the beginning of the senior year, the student selects a field of inquiry from the curriculum - literature, philosophy, math, science, the arts - and then selects a faculty member to act as his or her thesis advisor. The thesis is an exploration of one of the "Six Great Ideas" of humanity summarized as Truth, Beauty, Goodness, Justice, Liberty, and Equality. The first semester involves the selection of readings, directed study, note-taking, and conversation with the advisor. The second semester involves the writing of the thesis in sections, with the advisor offering feedback and guidance at each successive stage. The thesis is not a research paper, and it should not attempt to prove a specific point. Rather, the senior is asked to logically develop and assertively present his or her own philosophy on a topic of personal interest derived from the chosen texts. The thesis culminates with the senior defending his or her final draft in front of a committee of three faculty member."* - [Chandler Prep Curriculum Description](http://www.chandlerprep.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=71&layout=default&date=2012-01-01)

## Introduction ##

<!-- Citation: http://www.fi.edu/color/rainbow.html -->

One of the most simple, yet beautiful things in nature is that of a rainbow. A rainbow at its base is simple an arch of colors in the sky that ones sees. However, when one dives deeper into this simple display of nature they are confronted with some interesting facts. First off, when one looks upon a rainbow most people think it is made up of only the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. However, a rainbow is actually made of colors that even one's eyes can not see. That though is not the only thing unique and special about this simple thing. Rainbows are formed by light refracting water droplets at a 42&deg; angle and strike the view's eye. However, two view's eyes can not be in the same place at the same time. Thus, no two people receive the refracted light. As a result, every person  who looks upon a rainbow, see their own "personal" rainbow. To some, this might seem like an intriguing  "fun fact" to share with friends in some form of entertainment. To some philosophers, this simple "fun fact" presents a problem. 

According to some philosophers, one does not simply know a rainbow. <!-- Lord of the rings reference lol: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=0tMv5uj0odM ---> After realizing the nature of how a rainbow is observed, a philosopher is bombarded with a series of questions: How should one actually view a rainbow? Since every vantage point from which a person views this rainbow is unique, which vantage point is the true or best vantage point? Another question that might be asked is, if every one of these vantage points are unique, how can they all still be the same rainbow? On the other side, though, an ignorant person might put this thought aside stating, "This is a phenomenon and does not come about often," or, "It is a trivial thing, and thus we should not concern ourselves with it." However, a well versed reader will be quick to point out to you that this simple difference of vantage points causes immense differences in how things are viewed. A situation like this comes forth in Abbott's work, *Flatland*.

In *Flatland*, Abbott presents forth to the reader a scene of a square who is unaware of the world (dimensions) around him. The square believes that the way he sees and is able to understand things in is simple two dimensional vantage point must be the only way things should be understood. It is not until a series of events, including looking upon things in dimensions below himself, as well as being ripped from his own dimension of existence into another, that he is pulled into "the light", truth. From these new vantage points, he is able to fully see himself, and his relationship to everything else. As a result of his new found enlightenment, he is compelled to announce to the world his revelations. This is much like how the philosopher Hearne’s feels the need to confess the truth and thus write *Bandit*.

In Vicki Hearne's *Bandit*, Vicki Hearne is a professional (a professional dog trainer to be more specific). However, at the same time, she is a philosopher. As a result, since they are both a part of herself, she must appeal to both. One scene that clearly presents this troubling split is that of her brining Bandit out of the pound. During this scene, while she is taking off Bandit's collar, she pinches her finger in it. From this simple moment, results to completely opposite responses. As a professional, she does not confess to those around her that she has done this. However, the lack of laying out the truth compels her to confess the experience in the form of a book. Thus, creating the book in which this whole scene takes places. Through this book, she is able to examine herself from the vantage point of overlooking herself. This is much like how Plato's Socrates is able to, with his metaphor of the city and his soul, fully view himself. <!-- Insert Plato Stuff somehow here?? -->Aristotle ponders upon the method or force that allows this movement.

Aristotle presents to us a force: a mechanism by which one is able to move. The means that cause movement prove a way in which a man is able to move between viewpoints – perspectives. As a result, in Abbott’s language, he gives us the force that allows a person to move “upward” not just northward. By that, it is meant that he provides the force that allows something to move in and out of something not just across. This is the same as when Plato pulls someone out of his cave in order to bring them out of a lie and towards the truth.

In order to know truth, it must be known fully. This simple statement might seem self-explanatory but it is discovered that this is not the case. How can someone fully know something? In Abbott’s *Flatland*, the shapes debate this and determine that sight is inferior and angles are the best. However, the square later discovers that this is not the best method. As soon as he moves outside of his viewpoint, his rules of knowing suddenly become insufficient. They are found not be applicable to each dimension. He finds that there are many ways of knowing a truth based on the perspective. As a result, to truly know something, he finds it must be known from all perspectives. Thus, the square discovers he didn’t fully know, as he didn’t know it from the vantage points of all the dimensions.

These authors present forth a framework, a compiling of a set of perspectives that are a kind of dimensional way of viewing truth based on a person’s analyzing of their self in relationship to ultimately the universe. The first being that of realizing one’s existing and being able to view one’s self internally. The second is one’s relationship with others (humans). The third dimension is being able to look upon the relationship of one’s self and his other taken as one compared to the rest of world. Finally, the fourth is creation’s relationship with the divine. This is one’s cosmic relationship – one’s relationship with his universe, existence, divine, creator, or the ultimate highest truth.

According to these authors, a thing must be analyzed in the order of these perspectives. Therefore, in order to find the truth of the universe, a man must not only know truth from a single sight, but rather see it from all perspectives. A man who does not see a thing from all perspectives does not truly know it. Thus it can be said: <u>Man’s compounding climb of perspectives gives him the global vantage point to fully see and thus identify truth.</u> <!-- I hate underlining just fyi -->

## Overview of Our Exploration ##

<!-- Definitions Outline???? Here?? -->

When attempting to build a chair, one can suddenly stand up and decide, "I am going to build a chair." However, one can not go ahead and build that chair without first determining how they are going to first go about building that chair properly. In making of a chair, artists take time to determine what it should look like, and how they should go about to make the chair. In this way they are provided a path to follow on their course of chair making that helps them reach their ultimate goal of making a chair. Similarly, before going about the endeavor of determining qualities of the nature of perspective, and truth, a plan of attack must be made. As a result, before diving deeper into the topic at hand, some guiding questions, and a plan of attack must be laid out.

To gain a set of questions, one must contemplate the primary texts. In Abbott's 



As a result the following are gained as the guiding questions:

* What are the vantage points from which you can identify truth?

* What vantage point does man need to identify truth?

* How does man move through these vantage points?

* How does man know he has the right identification?

These are our primary guiding questions, because, as you will discover throughout this paper, are universal to all the primary texts.

After gaining a plan of attack must be outlines.

 

In asking this question, one seeks to identify specifically the nature (essential qualities), location, and significance of these vantage points. It must also be kept in mind that in asking this question, all the vantage points are laid out from which truth can be identified, instead of simply the best ones or the ones from which man uses. 

* What are the vantage points from which you can identify truth?

* What vantage point does man need to identify truth?

* How does man move through these vantage points?

* How does man know he has the right identification?

I actually have no clue if this paragraph is needed soooo lets skip it for now and focus on other paragraphs.

## Macro Look ##

For the purpose of this paper, we will explore 4 types different vantage points. In order to derive them, we must first steer our sights towards Abbot's text *Flatland*. In *Flatland*, the square is initially unaware of the other dimensions around himself. From this simple standpoint, it may seem, since he is unaware of the other dimensions around him, that he would not have many vantage points to look from. However, that statement is untrue. From this moment, we can see that he has the viewpoint of 3 vantage points.

The first is that of being able to look upon himself. From the text it can be seen that he is able to look upon himself: he is aware of his own thoughts and emotions. This vantage point, for this paper, will be labeled the first vantage point. As a result of the first vantage point, a person is able to judge and evaluate himself on a personal level, and explore himself internally. He is not able to realize he himself exists, but he is able to realize his own nature. This is powerful because, as a result of having the first vantage point, one may start understanding himself at a basic level. One can find a person using the first vantage point in places where the first person of speech is used. An example of this is seen when the square is describing about himself. Although this vantage point is powerful, as it is the basic block to self discovery, a person does not fully understand himself. In addition, this vantage point is only concerned with a single party. It is not until the second vantage point that another party is added.

In the second vantage point. One is able to view his own relationship with another. In this vantage point, a person must be able to view himself and the other, abstractly speaking, from a point at which he can see his own self and the other person at once. It is from this vantage point that a person first starts to leave himself. It is also the first time a person needs another to establish a new vantage point. It is because of this vantage point that, as we will see later, even the most intellectually advance people need another to fully view things. An example of this is seen in that even Aristotle's Great Souled Man needs a friend. <!-- Quote Here ….might be a different man-->. It can be seen from this, that as a result of this vantage point, the second person is used. More importantly, we can see that as a result of this vantage point, it is the first time action comes into place. A person has now been expanded to have action, thoughts, and feelings. Empowered with these new found abilities, a person seems to be able to start to accurately view things. However, the person is lacking another vantage point. He is lacking something to use in order to characteristics and draw conclusion his own relationship with the 3rd party. As a result, the person needs an even higher vantage point in order to make a better judgement. This vantage point, we will call the third vantage point. 

The third is being able to look upon one's self and a third party taken as one compared to the rest of the universe. By universe it is meant the set of things that have come to exist, which includes time itself. As a result, of this vantage a person is able to compare almost anything to each other, and himself. The person becomes both a master of space, and time. An example of this person is those that exist in Aristotle's contemplative realm. <!-- Quote --> . Those who exist in this realm are able to leave physical existence altogether, through thought. They once again go back to a metaphysical realm, similarly to the first vantage point, but unlike the first vantage point, the third is outside of one's self and is more inclusive. However this is not the last vantage point that a person can have.  

The last vantage point is that of the a person's (a creation's) relationship with his creator. This is the fourth and final vantage point, which we will more formally refer to as one's relationship with the divine (his source of existence). As a result of this view point, one is able to evaluate being, and as a result be able to understand himself in a different way. <!-- Quote the bible moses or abraham or noah. -->. 

<!-- How does one move about these realms -->



" Imagination does not breed insanity. Exactly what does breed insanity is reason. Poets do not go mad; but chess-players do. Mathematicians go mad, and cashiers; but creative artists very seldom. I am not, as will be seen, in any sense attacking logic: I only say that this danger does lie in logic, not in imagination. Artistic paternity is as wholesome as physical paternity. Moreover, it is worthy of remark that when a poet really was morbid it was commonly because he had some weak spot of rationality on his brain. Poe, for instance, really was morbid; not because he was poetical, but because he was specially analytical. Even chess was too poetical for him; he disliked chess because it was full of knights and castles, like a poem. He avowedly preferred the black discs of draughts, because they were more like the mere black dots on a diagram. Perhaps the strongest case of all is this: that only one great English poet went mad, Cowper. And he was definitely driven mad by logic, by the ugly and alien logic of predestination. Poetry was not the disease, but the medicine; poetry partly kept him in health. He could sometimes forget the red and thirsty hell to which his hideous necessitarianism dragged him among the wide waters and the white flat lilies of the Ouse. He was damned by John Calvin; he was almost saved by John Gilpin. Everywhere we see that men do not go mad by dreaming. Critics are much madder than poets. Homer is complete and calm enough; it is his critics who tear him into extravagant tatters. Shakespeare is quite himself; it is only some of his critics who have discovered that he was somebody else. And though St. John the Evangelist saw many strange monsters in his vision, he saw no creature so wild as one of his own commentators. The general fact is simple. Poetry is sane because it floats easily in an infinite sea; reason seeks to cross the infinite sea, and so make it finite. The result is mental exhaustion"
