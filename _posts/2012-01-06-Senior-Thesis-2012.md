### Preface ###

For my senior year in High School, we must write a thesis. This is what this is. Please note, all text is copyright to Anthony Kosednar 2012. I am putting it up here while I work in order to share it with others for revision. I do not authorize the reuse of my work…Do not share!

### Introduction ###

<!-- Citation: http://www.fi.edu/color/rainbow.html -->

One of the most simple, yet beautiful things in nature is that of a rainbow. A rainbow at its base is simple an arch of colors in the sky that ones sees. However, when one dives deeper into this simple display of nature they are confronted with some interesting facts. First off, when one looks upon a rainbow most people think it is made up of only the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. However, a rainbow is actually made of colors that even one's eyes can not see. That though is not the only thing unique and special about this simple thing. Rainbows are formed by light refracting water droplets at a 42 degree angle and hit the view's eye. However, two view's eyes can not be in the same place at the same time. Thus, no two people receive the refracted light. As a result, every person  who looks upon a rainbow, see their own "personal" rainbow. To some, this might seem like an intriguing  "fun fact" to share with friends in some form of entertainment. To some philosophers, this simple "fun fact" presents a problem. How should one actually view this rainbow? Since every vantage point from which a person views this rainbow is unique, which vantage point is the true or best vantage point? Another question that might be asked is, if every one of these vantage points are unique, how can they all still be the same rainbow? An ignorant person might put this thought aside stating, "This is a phenomenon and does not come about often," or, "It is a trivial thing, and thus we should not concern ourselves with it." However, a well versed reader will be quick to point out to you that this simple difference of vantage points causes immense differences in how things are viewed. A situation like this comes forth in Abbott's work, *Flatland*.

In *Flatland*, Abbott presents forth to the reader a scene of a square who is unaware of the world (dimensions) around him. The square believes that the way he sees and is able to understand things in is simple two dimensional vantage point must be the only way things should be understood. It is not until a series of events, including looking upon things in dimensions below himself, as well as being ripped from his own dimension of existence into another, that he is pulled into "the light", truth. From these new vantage points, he is able to fully see himself, and his relationship to everything else. As a result of his new found enlightenment, he is compelled to announce to the world his revelations. This is much like how the philosopher Hearne’s feels the need to confess the truth and thus write Bandit.

In Vicki Hearne’s Bandit, Vicki Hearne is a professional, a dog trainer. At the same time, though, she is a philosopher. As result, she must appeal to both. One scene that presents this troubling split clearly is that of her bringing Bandit out of the pound. While she is taking off Bandit’s collar, she pinches her finger in it. In the moment, as a professional, she does not confess that she has done this. The lack of laying out the truth compels her to confess the experience in the form of a book. As a result of creating this book, she is able to examine herself from the perspective of overlooking herself. This is much like how Plato’s Socrates is able to, with his metaphor of the city and his soul, fully view himself. Aristotle ponders upon the method or force that allows this movement.
