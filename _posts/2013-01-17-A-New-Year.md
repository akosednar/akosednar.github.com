Well last year's plan to post more frequently did not turn out how I planned. I had a lot more go on last year then I thought would happen. I finished my thesis, graduate high school, started colleged, and did a lot of work. 

However, this year will be different! This year, I will be publishing blog entries more often, as well as publishing code samples to my github (with a blog post overviewing it). 

So let's hope this works, and you start seeing a lot more posts!
